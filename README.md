# Idea Description

<b>Drones</b> are believed to be a “game-changer” for fighting this <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic. These aerial robots have a special kind of aura for themselves. During this situation, where the globe is in a strict lockdown, my team has come up with a few cardinal ideas. These ideas, when implemented in the real world, will bring up the change we wanted. <b>A.I.D. COPTER</b>, which stands for <b>Aware</b>, <b>Inspect</b>, and <b>Deliver</b>, are the three critical things that need to be done during this global lockdown.  

  #  Awareness: 
  This is the time where people of all types need to get aware of the current situation.
  
a. Our prototyped solution would be enabled with a <b>stentorian</b> (loud and powerful) speaker, which is compatible with the drone. This     speaker can be used to give proper guidelines to the people who aren’t following the laws during this pandemic.

b. Our project is enabled with an <b>A.I. chatbot</b>, which can be used for the predictive analysis of the near future. This bot can help    the users to be aware of the COVID-19 symptoms. They can even approach us via this manner too. The bot is enabled to analyze the            database.

c. We are using AI models to analyse the current database of covid 19 cases and predict future hotspots to create awareness before the        virus hits.

 #  Inspect: 
  Keeping an eye over the people is always essential, and it suits the best during this time.
  
a. Keeping the aerial reconnoiter in mind, we can keep an eye on the lawbreakers. This solution helps the police by not getting in          contact with the virus at any given a chance.

b. Real-time surveillance is equipped with A.I. algorithms to detect people in groups and later in from the task and the medical staff      with the exact place of the incident.

c. We are currently working on using existing Bluetooth databases of infected people to identify which person is  infected in each          group.

 # Deliver: 
   Deliver: It is vital to keep our tummy full and ourselves hygienic. So, we at A.I.D. COPTERS even deliver too.

a. Providing delivery services back to the dependent people during the lockdown is necessary. This is one of the most significant hit services due to this lockdown, and we are getting it back.

b. We are trying to provide items like soaps, sanitizers, medicines, face masks, and other essential items like gloves. All of this would be running securely on the Ethereum network.

c. The current prototyped drone would be capable of lifting a payload of 4Kg.

In the coming future, we are planning to make this control as **autonomous** as possible. We would include an **interlinked network of multiple drones** to cover vast places in a short time.
