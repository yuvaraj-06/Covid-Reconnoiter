# Idea Description:

Drones are believed to be a “game-changer” for fighting this COVID-19 pandemic. These aerial robots have a special kind of aura for themselves. During this situation, where the globe is in a strict lockdown, my team has come up with a few cardinal ideas. These ideas, when implemented in the real world, will bring up the change we wanted. E.I.D. COPTER, which stands for Employ, Inspect, and Deliver, are the three critical things that need to be done during this global lockdown. E.I.D. COPTER, which stands for Employ, Inspect, and Deliver. These are the three trivial things which saves someone’s skin during the strict lockdown which is being implemented across the globe.


# Inspiration:

COVID-19, ruined massive industries like the Tech industry, E-commerce Industry, Travel and Tourism industry, Agriculture Industry, and many other vital sources for income. Worse luck, this has even taken the lives of many innocents also, which is the prime inspiration for our project. We came up with an idea of doing a project which ultimately supports the current global lockdown situation. 
 Using cool high-end technologies, our prototyped solution is market-ready. It has the capability to alert people by making alerting stentorian sounds from the speaker

# Proposed Solution: -

### Employ:
With the global employment rates degrading by a 40%, it will approximately take 3-8 years for a complete backup for the world as one. We at E.I.D copter are planning to employ required people then inspect and deliver the essential goods during this lockdown. Everything will be maintained systematically on a blockchain network. Since Employment is a huge issue in the current scenario.We have decided to take help of interested people (crowd source) to monitor alerts and perform constant analysis of drone and its video feed. All this is stored in a secure blockchain for added data security.

### Inspect:
Keeping an eye over the people is always essential, and it suits the best during this time.

a. Keeping the aerial reconnoiter in mind, we can keep an eye on the lawbreakers. This solution helps the police by not getting in contact with the virus at any given a chance.

b. Real-time surveillance is equipped with A.I. algorithms to detect people in groups and later in from the task and the medical staff with the exact place of the incident.

c. We are currently working on using existing Bluetooth databases of infected people to identify which person is infected in each group.

### Deliver:
Deliver: It is vital to keep our tummy full and ourselves hygienic. So, we at A.I.D. COPTERS even deliver too.

a. Providing delivery services back to the dependent people during the lockdown is necessary. This is one of the most significant hit services due to this lockdown, and we are getting it back.

b. We are trying to provide items like soaps, sanitizers, medicines, face masks, and other essential items like gloves. All of this would be running securely on the Ethereum network.

c. The current prototyped drone would be capable of lifting a payload of 4Kg.

In the coming future, we are planning to make this control as autonomous as possible. We would include an interlinked network of multiple drones to cover vast places in a short time.

### Challenges we ran into?

1) Integrating the object detection into the drone’s camera is a big challenge that we faced during the hackathon.
2) Understanding the flight dynamics for a stable flight gave us some trouble, so we had to do some extra PID tuning. 

### Future Scopes

To cover a vast area in less time launching a network of these low-cost UAVs- as a swarm robot would be more efficient. The master and slave network will be easily controllable by the ground station.
Using advanced technologies like edge-computing and cloud services is what we want to accomplish in the coming future.

  #  Awareness: 
  This is the time where people of all types need to get aware of the current situation.
  
a. Our prototyped solution would be enabled with a <b>stentorian</b> (loud and powerful) speaker, which is compatible with the drone. This     speaker can be used to give proper guidelines to the people who aren’t following the laws during this pandemic.

b. Our project is enabled with an <b>A.I. chatbot</b>, which can be used for the predictive analysis of the near future. This bot can help    the users to be aware of the COVID-19 symptoms. They can even approach us via this manner too. The bot is enabled to analyze the            database.

c. We are using AI models to analyse the current database of covid 19 cases and predict future hotspots to create awareness before the        virus hits.

In the coming future, we are planning to make this control as **autonomous** as possible. We would include an **interlinked network of multiple drones** to cover vast places in a short time.
